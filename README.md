# Graphics Projects

PaintApp: This is a simple paint tool I developed using OpenGL as a school project.

Sphere Shading: An example of how shading and lighting is implemented using raycasting and raytracing.

## Description

PaintApp: There are two separate views that PaintApp uses, the toolbar and the actual canvas. The toolbar gives access to shapes, 
colors, pens, and erasers. The canvas is where you draw. There is mouse tracking to determine where and what you are clicking so that
everything occures where it is suppose to occure. You can't draw things in the toolbar and you can't select things in the canvas.

Sphere Shading: I created 3 spheres in a 3D environment that have different XYZ coordinates, surface textures, and reflective properties.
There are a variety of light sources that shine light differently from different coordinates. Light may reflect off the surface of one 
sphere onto another or that sphere may block the light from another. This must all be taken into account to properly visualize and 
calculate how the light travels and is spreads around the sphere.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Both projects can be run with Visual Studio 2015 or greater. C++ is required of course.
